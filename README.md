## Overview

KiddyKam introduces a revolutionary tool to support parents look after their children. By utilizing an object detection model, KiddyKam can keep track of a baby and follow it around the house. The parent can monitor their baby via the live webcam stream through the VIAM app.

## How It Works

We built the baby detection using VIAM's computer vision and machine learning. We also accessed the point cloud data from the camera to help follow the baby at a safe distance.

## How to Run

Install the viam software at [https://docs.viam.com/installation/](https://docs.viam.com/installation/). Run the `main.py` file using Python 3.10 or greater.
